I’m a software developer with a degree in [insert degree name] from [insert university name]. I love building solutions that are both functional and user-friendly, and I bring a problem-solving mindset to every project I work on.

Outside of coding, you’ll find me tackling puzzles, bouldering, reading, or chasing that next challenge. Whether it’s on a climbing wall or in a codebase, I thrive on finding smart solutions and pushing myself to improve — a mindset I bring into every job I take on.
